Hello, first Thank you for all your efforts.
the first bug is always when someone walikng(run) the figure just freeze and walk and some creatures around.
the second bug,after a some minutes/30 the game crashes or the server closing by it self and its disturbing to the gameplay.
the third bug is that sometime someone of the players see enemys or character while the second player dont see.
another bug,sometimes someone from the players can get a bug and start to walk realy slow or realy fast.
another one,sometimes the players cant see each other and have to teleport somewhere or try to reconnect or even restart the server.
AND AGAIN REALY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS WE REALLY APRECCIATE YOU,You are fulfilling our dream<3.
